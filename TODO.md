# MarketPipe MVP Roadmap

**MVP Goal**: Deliver a production-ready ETL pipeline that ingests 1-minute OHLCV bars from Alpaca, persists data via SQLite+Parquet, aggregates to multiple timeframes, validates quality, and exposes CLI commands with ≥70% test coverage.

## Priority Legend
- 🔴 **Critical** - Blocks MVP completion
- 🟡 **High** - Required for production readiness  
- 🟢 **Medium** - Enhances reliability/usability
- 🔵 **Low** - Nice-to-have improvements

- [x] 🟡 **Complete SymbolBarsAggregate business rules** _(daily summary calculation, event emission)_ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced add_bar() with running totals, close_day() with VWAP calculation
  - Depends on: ✅ SqliteSymbolBarsRepository
- [x] 🟡 **Implement remaining domain services** _(OHLCVCalculationService, MarketDataValidationService)_ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full business logic with Decimal precision, comprehensive validation rules
- [x] 🟢 **Add domain event handlers** _(connect orphaned events to subscribers)_ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Event handlers structure with logging and metrics integration
