# MarketPipe MVP Roadmap

**MVP Goal**: Deliver a production-ready ETL pipeline that ingests 1-minute OHLCV bars from Alpaca, persists data via SQLite+Parquet, aggregates to multiple timeframes, validates quality, and exposes CLI commands with ≥70% test coverage.

## Priority Legend
- 🔴 **Critical** - Blocks MVP completion
- 🟡 **High** - Required for production readiness  
- 🟢 **Medium** - Enhances reliability/usability
- 🔵 **Low** - Nice-to-have improvements
