# Security Policy

## üîí Supported Versions

MarketPipe is currently in alpha development. We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 0.1.0-alpha.x | ‚úÖ Yes | Current alpha series |
| < 0.1.0 | ‚ùå No | Pre-release versions |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Software Notice**: As MarketPipe is in alpha, security policies and procedures are still evolving. We take security seriously but recommend additional caution when using alpha software in production environments.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of MarketPipe seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### üìß How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email us at: **security@marketpipe.dev** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: The potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Any code, screenshots, or logs that demonstrate the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue (optional)

### üïê Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours** and will send a more detailed response within **5 business days** indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, we will:

1. **Confirm the vulnerability** and determine its severity
2. **Develop a fix** and test it thoroughly
3. **Prepare a security advisory** with details about the vulnerability
4. **Release the fix** and publish the advisory
5. **Credit you** for the discovery (if desired)

### üéØ Scope

The following are **in scope** for vulnerability reports:

#### **Core Application**
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication and authorization bypasses
- Data exposure or leakage
- SQL injection or NoSQL injection
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Remote code execution
- Denial of service vulnerabilities

#### **Data Security**
- Credential exposure in logs or configuration
- Insecure data storage
- Insufficient encryption of sensitive data
- API key or token exposure

#### **Infrastructure**
- Docker container vulnerabilities
- Database security issues
- Configuration vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities (if not already known)

### ‚ùå Out of Scope

The following are **not in scope**:

- **Alpha software limitations**: Issues inherent to alpha software status
- **Rate limiting**: Issues with API rate limiting (expected behavior)
- **DoS via resource exhaustion**: Unless it's an amplification attack
- **Social engineering**: Attacks that rely on human interaction
- **Physical attacks**: Physical access to systems
- **Attacks requiring privileged access**: That don't escalate privileges

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using MarketPipe, follow these security best practices:

#### **Credential Management**
- **Never hardcode credentials** in configuration files
- Use **environment variables** or secure credential management systems
- **Rotate API keys** regularly
- **Use minimum required permissions** for API keys

#### **Data Protection**
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest when possible
- **Use secure network connections** (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Regularly backup data** with encryption
- **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity

#### **Infrastructure Security**
- **Keep MarketPipe updated** to the latest version
- **Use containerization** with security best practices
- **Implement network security** (firewalls, VPNs)
- **Monitor system resources** and access

### For Developers

When contributing to MarketPipe:

#### **Code Security**
- **Follow secure coding practices**
- **Validate all inputs** from external sources
