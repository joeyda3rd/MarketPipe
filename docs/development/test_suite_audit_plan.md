# Test Suite Audit Plan: Nine Quality Layers Coverage Analysis

## Objective

Design and implement an automated audit system that identifies and reports coverage gaps across nine distinct quality layers (Unit, Contract, Property-based, Integration, Golden-dataset, Data-quality assertions, Performance/Load, Chaos/Fault injection, and Smoke in staging). The audit will systematically classify existing tests, detect missing coverage areas, and provide actionable recommendations for test suite completeness.

## Context & Constraints

- **Existing Infrastructure**: pytest-based test suite with established patterns
- **MarketPipe Domain**: Financial ETL pipeline with data ingestion, validation, and storage components
- **Quality Focus**: Emphasis on data quality, API reliability, and production readiness
- **Resource Constraints**: Leverage existing tooling where possible, minimize new dependencies
- **Compliance Requirements**: Financial data processing demands comprehensive validation and audit trails

## Tools & Libraries (pytest, coverage.py, Python stdlib, optional extras)

**Core Tools:**
- `pytest` - Test execution and discovery framework
- `coverage.py` - Code coverage analysis and reporting
- `ast` (Python stdlib) - Abstract syntax tree parsing for test classification
- `pathlib` (Python stdlib) - File system operations
- `json` (Python stdlib) - Report generation and data serialization
- `re` (Python stdlib) - Pattern matching for test categorization

**Optional Enhancements:**
- `hypothesis` - Property-based testing library detection
- `pytest-benchmark` - Performance testing identification
- `pytest-mock` - Mock usage analysis for contract testing
- `pydantic` - Schema validation for report structures
- `rich` - Enhanced console output for audit reports

## Scripts to Implement

### inventory_and_classify_tests.py
**Purpose**: Discover and categorize all existing tests into the nine quality layers
**High-level Logic**:
- Scan tests directory recursively for Python test files
- Parse AST to extract test function definitions, decorators, and imports
- Apply classification rules based on naming patterns, imports, and test structure
- Identify layer indicators: mocks (contract), hypothesis decorators (property-based), database fixtures (integration), performance markers, etc.
- Generate inventory mapping each test to its quality layer(s)
- Handle tests that span multiple layers or remain unclassified

### audit_test_layers.py
**Purpose**: Analyze test coverage gaps and generate comprehensive audit reports
**High-level Logic**:
- Load test inventory from classification step
- Define coverage expectations per layer based on codebase analysis
- Calculate coverage metrics: absolute counts, percentages, and gap analysis
- Identify critical paths lacking appropriate layer coverage
- Generate prioritized recommendations for missing test types
- Create visual coverage matrix showing layer completion status
- Export findings in multiple formats (JSON for automation, Markdown for human review)

## CI/CD Integration Points

**Pre-merge Checks**:
- Run audit on PR branches to detect coverage regressions
- Block merges if critical layers drop below defined thresholds
- Generate coverage diff reports comparing feature branch to main

**Scheduled Analysis**:
- Weekly full audit runs to track coverage trends over time
- Monthly comprehensive reports with recommendations
- Quarterly review cycles with stakeholder presentations

**Integration Hooks**:
- GitHub Actions workflow step for automated audit execution
- Coverage badges and status checks in repository README
- Slack/email notifications for significant coverage changes
- Integration with existing test reporting infrastructure

## Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

**Primary Deliverables**:
1. **Automated Audit System** - Fully functional scripts with CLI interface
2. **Coverage Reports** - JSON and Markdown reports for all quality layers
3. **CI/CD Integration** - Working GitHub Actions workflow
4. **Historical Tracking** - Trend analysis and baseline establishment
5. **Documentation** - Usage guide and maintenance procedures

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ All existing tests correctly classified into appropriate layers
- ✅ Coverage gaps identified with specific recommendations
- ✅ Reports generated in under 30 seconds for typical codebase size
- ✅ Zero false positives in critical path coverage analysis
- ✅ CI integration provides actionable feedback without noise
- ✅ Historical data preserved for trend analysis

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk: Misclassification of Tests**
- *Mitigation*: Implement manual review process for edge cases, maintain classification rules in version control

**Risk: Performance Impact on CI Pipeline**
- *Mitigation*: Optimize AST parsing, implement caching, run full audits on schedule rather than every commit

**Risk: False Coverage Confidence**
- *Mitigation*: Focus on quality metrics not just quantity, include effectiveness scoring

**Risk: Team Adoption Resistance**
- *Mitigation*: Start with reporting-only mode, provide clear value demonstration, involve team in rule definition

**Risk: Maintenance Overhead**
- *Mitigation*: Design self-documenting classification rules, implement automated rule validation
