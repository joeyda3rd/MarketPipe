# Test Automation Strategy - MarketPipe

## üìã Overview

This document outlines MarketPipe's multi-layered strategy to ensure that appropriate tests are **never missed accidentally** when making code changes. The system automatically detects changes and runs relevant tests, preventing regressions while maintaining fast development cycles.

## üéØ Problem Statement

**The Challenge:** How do we ensure developers run the right tests without slowing down the development process?

**Common Issues:**
- Developers forget to run tests related to their changes
- Running the full test suite for every small change is too slow
- Manual test selection is error-prone and inconsistent
- Integration tests get skipped during rapid development
- Coverage gaps appear in areas not obviously related to changes

## üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Layered Protection Strategy

### Layer 1: Intelligent Test Detection
**Smart Test Runner** (`scripts/smart_test_runner.py`)

Automatically analyzes git changes and maps them to relevant test files using pattern matching:

```bash
# Run tests for changed files since last commit
make test-smart

# See what tests would run without executing
make test-smart-all

# Get the exact command to run
make test-smart-cmd
```

**File-to-Test Mappings:**
- CLI changes ‚Üí CLI unit + integration tests
- Domain changes ‚Üí Domain tests + DDD guard rails
- Infrastructure changes ‚Üí Infrastructure + integration tests
- Provider adapters ‚Üí Provider-specific tests
- Database changes ‚Üí Migration + database tests
- Configuration changes ‚Üí Full integration suite

### Layer 2: Pre-Commit Hooks
**Automatic test execution before commits** (`.githooks/pre-commit`)

- Analyzes staged files
- Runs relevant tests automatically
- Prevents commits with failing tests
- Provides escape hatches for urgent fixes

```bash
# Normal commit (tests run automatically)
git commit -m "fix: update CLI validation"

# Skip tests for urgent fixes
SKIP_TESTS=1 git commit -m "hotfix: critical production issue"

# Skip all git hooks
git commit --no-verify -m "wip: work in progress"
```

### Layer 3: Coverage-Based Verification
**Test coverage analysis** integrated with change detection

- Tracks which code areas are affected by changes
- Identifies tests that cover changed code
- Warns if changes aren't adequately tested
- Suggests additional tests for complex changes

### Layer 4: Safety Nets
**Multiple fallback mechanisms** to catch missed tests

1. **Unmatched File Detection:** If changed files don't match any pattern, run unit tests as safety net
2. **Critical File Protection:** Changes to critical files (CLI, domain core) trigger full test suite  
3. **Integration Test Requirements:** Infrastructure changes always trigger integration tests
4. **Full Suite Triggers:** Configuration/CI changes require complete test run

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Setup (One-time)
```bash
# Install test automation system
make setup-test-automation

# Verify installation
make test-smart-all
```

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
vim src/marketpipe/ingestion/coordinator.py

# 2. Stage your changes
git add .

# 3. Commit (tests run automatically)
git commit -m "feat: improve coordinator error handling"

# 4. Before pushing, run full suite
make test-all
```

## üìä Test Command Reference

### Fast Development Commands
| Command | Purpose | Speed | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `make test` | Last failed + fast | ‚ö° Fastest | During active development |
| `make test-smart` | Tests for changed files | ‚ö° Fast | After making changes |
| `make test-unit` | Unit tests only | ‚ö° Fast | Quick validation |
| `make test-fast` | No cache, fail fast | üî• Fast | Clean slate testing |

### Comprehensive Commands  
| Command | Purpose | Speed | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `make test-all` | Complete test suite | üêå Slow | Before pushing |
| `make test-integration` | Integration tests | üê¢ Slower | Infrastructure changes |
| `make ci-check` | Full CI simulation | üêå Slowest | Before major commits |

### Analysis Commands
| Command | Purpose | Output |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `make test-smart-all` | Show test mapping | Dry run with reasons |
| `make test-smart-cmd` | Get pytest command | Copy-paste ready |
| `make test-timing` | Performance analysis | Test duration report |

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration & Customization

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Skip all tests in git hooks
export SKIP_TESTS=1

# Pass custom pytest arguments  
export PYTEST_ARGS="--verbose --no-cov"

# Use different base reference for change detection
export TEST_BASE_REF=main
```

### File Pattern Customization
Edit `scripts/smart_test_runner.py` to customize file-to-test mappings:

```python
self.test_mappings = {
    # Add new patterns
    r"src/marketpipe/new_feature/": ["tests/unit/new_feature/"],
    
    # Modify existing patterns
    r"src/marketpipe/cli\.py": [
        "tests/unit/cli/", 
        "tests/integration/test_cli_*.py",
        "tests/e2e/test_cli_workflows.py"  # Add E2E tests
    ],
}
```

### Safety Net Configuration
Adjust safety nets in the smart test runner:

```python
# Change when full suite is triggered
self.critical_files = {
    "src/marketpipe/__init__.py",
    "src/marketpipe/cli.py",
    "src/marketpipe/domain/core.py",  # Add your critical files
}

# Modify unmatched file handling
if unmatched_src:
    unit_tests = self._expand_test_path("tests/unit/")
    for test_path in unit_tests[:10]:  # Increase safety net size
        # ... add to test suggestions
```

## üö® Failure Scenarios & Recovery

### When Tests Fail
```bash
# See what tests failed and why
make test-smart-all --show-mapping

# Run only the failing tests
pytest -q --lf --maxfail=1

# Skip tests for urgent commit
SKIP_TESTS=1 git commit -m "hotfix: urgent production fix"

# Fix tests and commit again
git add . && git commit -m "fix: resolve test failures"
```

### When Detection Fails
```bash
# Force full test suite
make test-all

# Override detection with custom command
pytest -q tests/specific_test.py

# Debug pattern matching
python3 scripts/smart_test_runner.py --show-mapping --dry-run
```

### Emergency Overrides
```bash
# Bypass all automation
git commit --no-verify

# Disable hooks temporarily
git config core.hooksPath /dev/null

# Re-enable hooks
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## üìà Metrics & Monitoring

### Test Automation Effectiveness
Track these metrics to ensure the system is working:

1. **Test Coverage:** Percentage of changed lines covered by executed tests
2. **Detection Accuracy:** How often the right tests are identified
3. **False Positive Rate:** Tests run that aren't relevant to changes
4. **Missed Regressions:** Bugs that escape the test net
5. **Developer Satisfaction:** Feedback on development speed vs. safety

### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Analyze test performance weekly
make test-timing

# Track automation overhead
time make test-smart vs time make test-all
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Integration with CI/CD
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Smart Test Analysis
  run: |
    python3 scripts/smart_test_runner.py --format json > test-plan.json
    
- name: Run Detected Tests
  run: |
    python3 scripts/smart_test_runner.py --fast
    
- name: Full Suite (if critical changes)
  run: |
    if grep -q "FULL_SUITE" test-plan.json; then
      make test-all
    fi
```

### IDE Integration
Configure your IDE to run smart tests:

**VS Code settings.json:**
```json
{
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
    "--lf", "--maxfail=3", "-q"
  ],
  "python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSaveEnabled": true
}
```

**PyCharm:** Configure run configuration with:
```bash
python3 scripts/smart_test_runner.py --format command
```

## üéì Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Always run `make test-smart` after making changes**
2. **Use `make test-all` before pushing to main**
3. **Check test mapping with `make test-smart-all` for complex changes**
4. **Don't bypass tests unless absolutely necessary**
5. **Add new pattern mappings when creating new modules**

### For Code Reviews
1. **Verify appropriate tests were run in PR description**
2. **Check if new code needs additional test mappings**
3. **Ensure integration tests cover cross-module changes**
4. **Validate that CI runs the full test suite**

### For Team Leads
1. **Monitor test automation metrics weekly**
2. **Update file patterns as codebase evolves**
3. **Review safety net effectiveness monthly**
4. **Adjust test thresholds based on team feedback**

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No tests detected for my changes"**
```bash
# Check file patterns
python3 scripts/smart_test_runner.py --show-mapping --dry-run

# Verify git status
git status
git diff --name-only

# Run safety net
make test-unit
```

**"Wrong tests are being run"**
```bash
# Review pattern mappings in scripts/smart_test_runner.py
# Add or modify patterns for your use case
# Test the changes with --dry-run
```

**"Tests are too slow"**
```bash
# Use faster commands during development
make test  # instead of make test-smart

# Optimize test selection
make test-unit  # for quick validation

# Check test timing
make test-timing
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
