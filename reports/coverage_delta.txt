- **Progress**: ✅ 5 fewer failures, 4 more passing tests

## Fixes Applied

### Task 1: Date Hardcoding Issues (3 tests fixed)
- `tests/ingestion/symbol_providers/test_nasdaq_dl.py::test_fetch_symbols_happy_path`
- `tests/ingestion/symbol_providers/test_nasdaq_dl.py::test_footer_with_extra_spaces`  
- `tests/unit/infrastructure/test_alpaca_market_data_adapter.py::test_translates_alpaca_bar_format_to_domain_ohlcv_bar`

**Root Cause**: Tests had hardcoded expected dates that didn't match current date
**Solution**: Updated expected dates to use dynamic values (`datetime.date.today()` and corrected timestamp calculations)

### Task 2: CLI Exit Code Issues (2 tests fixed)
- `tests/unit/cli/test_ingest_cli.py::test_ingest_cli_smoke`
- `tests/unit/cli/test_ingest_cli.py::test_ingest_cli_with_multiple_symbols`

**Root Cause**: CLI tests were failing during post-ingestion verification because `_check_boundaries()` function was trying to read actual data files that don't exist in test environment
**Solution**: Added mocks for `_check_boundaries()` function in addition to existing `_build_ingestion_services()` mocks

## Remaining Issues (26 failures)
The remaining failures follow similar patterns and can be addressed using the same techniques:

- **CLI Configuration Tests**: Need similar `_check_boundaries` mocking
- **Symbols CLI Tests**: Likely environment variable and configuration issues  
- **Integration Tests**: Data processing issues where mock data isn't being written to storage properly
- **Output Content Tests**: CLI output expectations that need updating

## Recommendations
1. Apply the `_check_boundaries` mock pattern to remaining CLI tests
2. Investigate integration test data writing issues
3. Update CLI output expectations to match actual behavior
4. Consider improving test isolation to prevent environmental dependencies
